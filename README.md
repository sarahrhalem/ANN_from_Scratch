# INM702_Mathematics_Programming_AI_Coursework

This coursework builds upon material covered in the INM702 module, demonstrated over several tasks:
Task 1 - Designing an integer maze using OOP and solving the maze through implementation of Nearest Neighbours baseline algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm and Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm.
Task 2 - Classifying an MNIST dataset using a multi-layer neural network designed and implemented from scratch.
Task 3- Comparing our developed solution to results obtained by developing a PyTorch ANN and suggestions for improvement based on more advanced methods.

Each task is split in a seperate Jupyter Notebook which contain all the code to run the file, the following files are for each task:

  *Task 1 - INM702_Task1.ipynb
  
  *Task 2 - INM702_Task2.ipynb
  
  *Task 3 - INM702_Task3_PyToch.ipynb

Results(.csv) and figures(.jpg) exported from the task notebooks are outputted to the following folders :

 Figures - contains folders for each Task1, Task2, Task3

 Results - contains folders for each Task1, Task2 (No csv results exported for Task 3 only figures)
 
Note: The zipped folder uploaded to moodle is also contained within the GitHub INM702_Task1_2_3_Code_SarahRhalem.zip
