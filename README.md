Task 1 - Designing an integer maze using OOP and solving the maze through implementation of Nearest Neighbours baseline algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm and Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm.
Task 2 - Classifying an MNIST dataset using a multi-layer neural network designed and implemented from scratch.
Task 3- Comparing our developed solution to results obtained by developing a PyTorch ANN and suggestions for improvement based on more advanced methods.

Each task is split in a seperate Jupyter Notebook which contain all the code to run the file, the following files are for each task:

  *Task 1 - INM702_Task1.ipynb
  
  *Task 2 - INM702_Task2.ipynb
  
  *Task 3 - INM702_Task3_PyToch.ipynb
